# Combo DL: Graph Optimization Via Deep Learning
This project uses deep and reinforcement learning to solve problems in combinatorial and extremal graph theory.
It currently focuses on finding novel [Strongly Regular Graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_regular_graph),
but the methods and code used are intentionally general and adaptable to a wide variety of other problems.

## Contributions
This project is part of an undergraduate honors thesis and is currently not accepting third-party contributions.
This will likely change after thesis submission, around April 2026.
